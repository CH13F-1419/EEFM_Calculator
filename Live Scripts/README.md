# Live Scripts
A Live Script in MATLAB functions pretty similarly to a Jupyter Notebook, with cells of code and text that can all be executed individually. This is Stage 1 of the Calculator: Creating Live Scripts for all basic EEFM functions for step-by-step execution (and also so I can plan for Stage 2, the actual scripting).

One *tiny* drawback I'd say you want to look out for (or maybe I don't know MATLAB that well lol) is that only MATLAB can actually view these files; opening these files in a text editor gives a maelstrom of satanic characters. Apart from that, it's all fine and dandy.
