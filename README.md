# EEFM_Calculator
A collection of MATLAB scripts to help automate EEFM calculations. Made by me while studying for my Engineering Economics and Financial Management (EEFM) course during my junior year at the Manipal Institute of Technology.
## My Tentative Checklist for this Project
I intend to break up this endeavour into three big stages:
[] Make Live Scripts for step-by-step analysis
[] Convert the Live Scripts into proper MATLAB functions so you can execute what you want in them from the command line
[] Make a consolidated toolbox for the same that can be installed in MATLAB, with more functionality
[] Make an interactive application(?) that will do all of the above(?)
[] (*Maybe*) Extrapolate this to other languages too
