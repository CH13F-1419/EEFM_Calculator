# EEFM_Calculator
This is a collection of (for now) MATLAB scripts to help automate basic EEFM calculations related to cash-flow diagrams, evaluating different investment options, the whole shebang. I decided to work on this while studying for my Engineering Economics and Financial Management (EEFM) course during my junior year of my B.Tech Mechatronics degree at the Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal.
## My Tentative Checklist
While I haven't fully yet decided how far I can (and want to) go with this thing, at the moment I intend to break it up into a few stages:
- [ ] Make Live Scripts for step-by-step analysis
- [ ] Convert the Live Scripts into proper MATLAB functions so you can execute what you want in them from the command line
- [ ] Make a consolidated toolbox for the same that can be installed in MATLAB, with more functionality
- [ ] Make an interactive application(?) that will do all of the above(?) ~Really not sure of this lol~
- [ ] (*Maybe*) Extrapolate this to other languages too!
