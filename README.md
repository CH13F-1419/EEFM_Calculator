# EEFM_Calculator
This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts to help automate EEFM calculations. I worked on this while studying for my Engineering Economics and Financial Management (EEFM) course during my junior year at the Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal.
## My Tentative Checklist for this Project
While I haven't fully yet decided how far I can (and want to) go with this project, at the moment I intend to break up this endeavour into a few big stages:
- [ ] Make Live Scripts for step-by-step analysis
- [ ] Convert the Live Scripts into proper MATLAB functions so you can execute what you want in them from the command line
- [ ] Make a consolidated toolbox for the same that can be installed in MATLAB, with more functionality
- [ ] Make an interactive application(?) that will do all of the above(?)
- [ ] (*Maybe*) Extrapolate this to other languages too

~~Just some test text, ignore this.~~
